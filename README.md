# About this repo

This is a basic template for front end development using Rust and HTMX. The idea is to include all baseline setup with tracing, livereload, templating, and initial routing for a server such that this can be cloned and immediately begin building templates and other routes.

## How to run

After running ```cargo install```, all that should be needed to beging editing is ```cargo watch -- cargo run``` to begin templating away!

Have fun!
